This is my homework 9. It is an automated workflow that takes that raw gapminder data and returns summary statistics and plots that examine the relationship between year and life expectancy for different continents. 


Suggested workflows:

  * Clone this directory. 
  * Start a fresh RStudio session, make sure this directory is the working directory.
  * Run the Makefile using Rstudio's "Build All" button.
  * Or, in a shell, use the command: `make all`
  * `make clean` can be used to delete all the files generated by `make all`
  * You can delete various intermediates "by hand" and use `make all` to re-run necessary parts of the pipeline.
